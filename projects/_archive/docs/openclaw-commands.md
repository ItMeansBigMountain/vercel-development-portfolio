# 🧠 What You Actually Need (80/20)

Ignore the noise. You’ll use:

| Category | Commands                     |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| Setup    | onboard, configure           |
| Runtime  | gateway start/restart/status |
| Debug    | status, logs, doctor         |
| Channels | channels add/status          |
| Memory   | memory                       |
| Updates  | update                       |

Everything else is secondary.

# ⚠️ Real Insight You’re Missing

This command list is NOT the system.

It’s just:

```text
Infrastructure layer
```

Your real power comes from:

```text
Agents + Memory + Workflows + Feedback loops
```

---

# 🧪 Next Move

You now have:

✅ Clean command system
❌ No operational brain yet

Next thing you need:

👉 **AGENTS.md (your org chart + behavior rules)**
👉 **SOUL.md (your system philosophy + constraints)**
👉 **PLAYBOOKS (browser automation steps)**

---

If you want this to actually print money instead of printing logs, next step is I build you:

**→ your first working OpenClaw agent system (COO + Trend + Clip pipeline)**
You handed me a raw command dump that looks like someone rage-documented their terminal. Let’s turn it into something a **system builder actually uses**, not a confused intern clicking random commands.
